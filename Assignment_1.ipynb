    "•\tString: A string is a data type in programming that represents a sequence of characters. It is used to store and manipulate text. In most programming languages, strings are enclosed in quotation marks (single or double). For example, 'hello' and \"world\" are both strings.\n",
    "•\tVariable: A variable is a named container or storage location that holds a value. It is used to store and represent data within a program. Variables can hold different types of values, including strings, numbers, booleans, and more. Unlike a string, a variable is not a data type itself but a way to reference or store data of different types. For example, in the statement name = 'John', name is a variable that holds the string value 'John'.\n",

    "Solution\n",
    "•\tInteger (int): The integer data type represents whole numbers without any decimal places. It includes both positive and negative numbers, as well as zero. Integers are used to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Examples of integers are -3, 0, 42.\n",
    "•\tString (str): The string data type represents a sequence of characters, such as letters, numbers, symbols, and whitespace. Strings are typically used to store and manipulate text-based data. They are enclosed in quotation marks (either single or double) to differentiate them from other data types. Examples of strings are \"Hello, World!\", \"OpenAI\", \"123\".\n",
    "•\tBoolean (bool): The boolean data type has two possible values: True or False. Booleans are used to represent logical conditions and are often the result of a comparison or a logical operation. They are fundamental in programming for making decisions and controlling the flow of a program. Examples of boolean values are True and False\n"
